Conclusion: 
- use f1, f2, f3, and (maybe f5).
- all these frame-level features can not differentiate music => need window-level features.

1. f1: Non-Initial Auto-correlation Peak 
is a very strong feature to differentiate: 
(1) voiced: 40 ~ 50 
(2) unvoiced <> 10
(3) silent <> 10
(4) ambient 0 ~ 30
- NOTE: all the values are original f1 feature values times 60.
- f1 can not be used to differentiate classical, pop music, and tv from human speech.

2. f2: Number of Auto-correlation Peaks
is a very strong feature only for differentiating voiced and unvoiced frames in very clean environment.
- silent: <> 30
- Under clean environment, 
(1) voiced: (2, 10)
(2) unvoiced: <> 30
NOTE: check speech_t3, i am not sure if f2 is calcuated correctly.
NOTE: not all voiced frames have low number of peaks. Some of them are high.
f2 is NOT good at noisy environment
- in restaurant:
(1) voiced <> 10
(2) background noise: (0, 15)
- outdoor:
(1) voiced <> 10
(2) background noise: < 10
- speech phone call fails
- ambient: is similar to voiced speech in clean environment.
- bus: <> 3
- cafe: (0, 10)
- walk: <> 3, with some spikes
- music: (5, 50)

3. f3: Relative Spectral Entropy (RSE) (300)
- bus: (5, 10)
- cafe: (5, 20)
- walk: (5, 20)
- silent: <> 10
- f3 fails at radio since most of the frames in radio is voiced. 
- classical music: (10, 60)
- some ambient sound is very similar to voiced frames
NOTE: tested on RSE = 300 frames, 500, and 800 frames and there is no significant difference.
NOTE: RSE only contributes in noisy environment
- NOTE: all the values are original f3 feature values times 60.

4. f4: Low-High Energy Ratio (25%)
- ambient: 
- walk: (0, 20)
- bus: <> 25
- cafe: (5, 15)
- silent: < 0
- voiced in clean environment: <> 10
- unvoiced in clean environment: < 0 
- background noise <> 10, => totally kills voiced frames
- classical music: some parts are < 0; however, some parts are <> 10, => f4 can not remove classical music
- speech from phonecall is < 0 due to frequency shift.
- NOTE: all the values are original f1 feature values times 10.

4. f4: Low-High Energy Ratio (12.5%)
is not a consistent feature for detecting voiced speech

4. f4: Low-High Energy Ratio (50%)
ambient is very similar to voiced frames

5. f5: Spectral Entropy
- ambient: 
very similar to voiced speech
- bus: <> 35
- cafe: <> 43
- walk: (35, 45)
- clean unvoiced, silent: <> 48
- clean voiced: < 45
- very susceptible to outdoor background noise for speech => this is why we need f3: Relative Spectral Entropy
- NOTE: all the values are original f1 feature values times 10.

6. f6: normalized energy is garbage

7. f7: total energy is garbage 
NOTE: all energy-related features are not reliable.

8. f8: ZCR is garbage. 

9. f9: MCR is garbage.
